*NOTE: I get many messages expressing interest in this system.  I plan on offering an Arduino programmable filght computer with open source code by late-2024. You can contact me at https://www.rocketryforum.com/members/sparkyvt.810/

HPR Rocket Flight Computer
Original sketch by SparkyVT
NAR #85720, L3
TRA #12111, L3

--------DESCRIPTION----------
This code base is the software to run an advanced flight computer in high-power amateur rockets. Hardware setups vary, but typically 
can fit within a 38mm airframe. It has similar capability as a TeleMega, but without a smart-phone app or advanced interfaces.  
Flight-tested on over 250 successful flights, including M-and-N powered supersonic flights to over 34K feet and Mach 2.3.  
For large or high-power projects, a commercially avialble backup computer is strongly recommended.
